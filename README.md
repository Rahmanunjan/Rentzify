# RENTZIFY - THE FIRST DECENTRALISED RENT DAPP!
A DeFi platform built on Moonbeam securing and monetising rent deposits. 

### SUMMARY
Rentzify is using an ERC-4626 solidity smart contract deployed on the Moonbeam parachain to make rent deposits secure. The security is via use of a decentralised platform. Additionally, the use of a smart contract and a Multisig controls access to rent deposits in the vault. Deposits will be added to the vault and a native token used to accord shares to users wallets. A Multisig Wallet will set up signatories to the funds with nominees from renters and Landlords ( 3 each). Deposits are withdrawn in the following conditions:
1. 4 out of 6 signatories sign the transaction.
2. Yield is earned on part or whole of the deposits. Borrowers pay 5% of their stake to the renters. Landlords receive 20% of the yield from the renters. The platform takes 2.5 %.

Non tenants can utilish flash loans, yield farming by staking an equivalent token into the Vault. Hence, tenants and landlords will be recipients of the yield bearing vault. 

### PROBLEM
1. Landlords are charging exorbitant rent deposits.
2. Landlords are refusing to return rent deposits.
3. Landlords are receiving rent deposits priot to property viewings.
4. Claims courts have a lengthy process while refunding claimed rent deposits.
